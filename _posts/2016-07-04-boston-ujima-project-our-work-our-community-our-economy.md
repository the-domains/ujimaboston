OUR WORK, OUR COMMUNITY, OUR ECONOMY 

THE BOSTON UJIMA PROJECT is organizing neighbors, workers, business owners and investors to create a new community‐controlled economy in Greater Boston. We are challenging poverty and developing our communities by organizing our savings, businesses and customers to grow local wealth and meet our own needs.

UJIMA (oo‐JEE‐mah) is a Swahili word, the celebrated Kwanzaa principle for "collective work and responsibility." Ujima inspires us to take responsibility for our communities, to see our neighbor's problems as our own, and to build collective power to solve them together. 

The Ujima Project demonstrates new ways to invest, work, buy, own, and advocate. We are driven by a
belief that another world possible, and that we can help build it today.
